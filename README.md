# What is ClamAV? 

ClamAVÂ® is an open source antivirus engine for detecting trojans, viruses, malware & other malicious threats.

Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) is a free software, cross-platform and open-source antivirus software toolkit able to detect many types of malicious software, including viruses. One of its main uses is on mail servers as a server-side email virus scanner. The application was developed for Unix and has third party versions available for AIX, BSD, HP-UX, Linux, macOS, OpenVMS, OSF (Tru64) and Solaris. As of version 0.97.5, ClamAV builds and runs on Microsoft Windows. Both ClamAV and its updates are made available free of charge.

Sourcefire, a maker of intrusion detection products and the owner of Snort, announced on 17 August 2007 that it had acquired the trademarks and copyrights to ClamAV from five key developers.

Upon joining Sourcefire, the ClamAV team joined the Sourcefire Vulnerability Research Team (VRT). In turn, Sourcefire was acquired by Cisco in 2013. The Sourcefire VRT became Cisco Talos, and ClamAV development remains there.
